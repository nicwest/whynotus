This document is the project masthead. You should be able to point to one of
these everytime you are working on this project.

1. Make things better
2. Do it in the open
3. Keep it boring
4. Simple != Easy
5. Always for sale


## Make things better

Generally speaking the goal of this project is to make things better. Today
that's in the space of improving hiring, tomorrow who knows.

Whether it's adding a feature, fixing a bug, answering an email, or planning a
budget, generally you should be leaving the project in the better state than
when you sat down.

The inverse is also implied in this: Avoid making things actively worse. Whether
that's in the code, a user experience, or someone's day.

## Do it in the open

I really like the idea of absolute transparency from day one. Nothing done
behind closed doors. 

This primarily me looking for a panopticon effect at the moment, but I also
fantasize about having sales and investor transcripts on github.

## Keep it boring

Boring technology is good technology.

## Simple != Easy

Just because something is easy, doesn't mean it's simple/not adding
complications. The inverse is also true, sometimes doing the simple thing is
hard.

Optimise for simple, even when it's hard.

## Always for sale

Like any good super yacht this project is for sale.

At some point I'll figure out a sensible way to value it, but for now I'll take
Â£250k cash with no strings attached. I hand over the project and all assets, and
disappear into the sunset. 250k is ~ 2 years of full time salary.
